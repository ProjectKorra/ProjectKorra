If you sneak (default: shift), anything around where you are looking at will instantly melt. Since this is a more favorable state for these things, they will never re-freeze unless they would otherwise by nature or some other bending ability. Additionally, if you tap sneak while targeting water with FreezeMelt, it will evaporate water around that block that is above sea level."

If you release shift during this, you will create a large wave that expands outwards from you, launching anything in its path back. Instead, if you click you release the water and channel it to flow towards your cursor. Anything caught in the blast will be tossed about violently and take damage.
