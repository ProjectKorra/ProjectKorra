## About ProjectKorra

ProjectKorra is a place for members across the Minecraft and Bending Communities to come together and interact. ProjectKorra is one of the biggest Minecraft and Avatar/Korra related communities around and is still growing rapidly. Our goal is to bridge the two communities, providing users with a way to implement aspects of the hit television shows "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and "The Legend of Korra" into Minecraft.
